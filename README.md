# U.S. Geological Survey (u-s-geological-survey)
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is a scientific agency of the U.S. government that conducts research and provides data on the natural resources and hazards of the United States. The USGS is known for its work in mapping and monitoring earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides to help mitigate risks and protect communities. They also study water resources, including monitoring groundwater levels and water quality, which is essential for managing and conserving water supplies. Additionally, the USGS conducts research on ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and climate change to inform environmental policies and decision-making. Overall, the USGS plays a vital role in understanding and preserving the natural environment of the United States.

### Species of Greatest Conservation Need Analysis Tool
Species of Greatest Conservation Need are lists of species designated in the 56 State Wildlife Action Plans which identify the species most in need of conservation action in that state or U.S. territory. USGS developed a process that allows these lists to be compiled into a national list, making their representation across taxa groups available via the Species Conservation Analysis Tool.

### Arkansas Wateruse
Since 1985 site-specific water-use data for several categories have been collected and compiled annually by the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission (ANRC) in cooperation with the USGS.Data for the irrigation and livestock ( animal specialties ) categories are reported through the Conservation District Offices in each county. Site-specific water-use data for public supply, commercial, industrial, mining, power generation, irrigation and livestock ( stock and animal specialties ) are stored in the USGS Arkansas Water Science Centers Water-Use Data Base System (WUDBS). Water-use data for domestic (self-supplied) and livestock (stock) are not required to report to ANRC.
