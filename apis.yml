  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is a scientific agency of the U.S.
  government that conducts research and provides data on the natural resources
  and hazards of the United States. The USGS is known for its work in mapping
  and monitoring earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides to help mitigate risks
  and protect communities. They also study water resources, including monitoring
  groundwater levels and water quality, which is essential for managing and
  conserving water supplies. Additionally, the USGS conducts research on
  ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and climate change to inform environmental
  policies and decision-making. Overall, the USGS plays a vital role in
  understanding and preserving the natural environment of the United States.
